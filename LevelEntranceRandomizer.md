# Level Entrance Randomizer

## How it works

If you enable the level entrance randomizer, the entrance to the action stages will be randomized.

If a level is accessible for your character, the entrance will be open, and it will show a green arrow pointing to it.

If a given entrance is closed, it indicates that the level behind that entrance is not accessible.
It will also show a red cross on the entrance to indicate that it's not accessible.

If you see an orange arrow, it means that you need to use the other entrance to access the level.

## Levels with multiple entrances

Depending on the character you're playing, you might have access to different entrances.
This is the list of every level with multiple entrances:

## Level list

This is a list of the levels, the requirements, and an explanation of how the entrances look when the level is
accessible or not for your character.

### Emerald Coast

All characters use the same entrance.

If the level is not accessible, the entrance will have a gate blocking the way. If it is accessible, the entrance will
be open.

For Gamma, the gate will always be there, but the targets won't show up if the level is not accessible.

### Windy Valley

All characters use the same entrance.

For Sonic, Tails, and Gamma, the Wind Stone won't spawn if the level is not accessible for the character. For Amy,
Knuckles, and Big, it will open as soon as you get the Wind Stone (there is no in-game Wind Stone for them).

### Casinopolis

All characters use the same entrance.

For Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles, the button won't open the casino door if the level is not accessible for the character.
For everyone else, the doors will be open from the start if the level inside is accessible.

### Ice Cap

All characters use the same entrance.

For Knuckles, Amy, and Gamma, the level will be accessible as soon as you get the Ice Stone (there is no in-game Ice
Stone for them). For Sonic, Tails, and Big, you still have to fetch the actual Ice Stone.

The ladder (and the load zone) won't spawn if the level is not accessible for the character.

### Twinkle Park

All characters use the same entrance.

The level's door won't open if the level is not accessible for the character.

### Speed Highway

Sonic, Tails, Amy, Big, and Gamma use the building entrance, and you'll need the Employee Card to enter the level.

Knuckles and use the city hall entrance, and he doesn't need the Employee Card.

The shutter/city hall doors won't open if the level is not accessible for the character.

Knuckles' city hall barricade won't spawn if the level is not accessible for him.

### Red Mountain

All characters use the same entrance.

For Sonic, Knuckles, and Gamma, the monkey will only spawn if the level is accessible for them.

For Tails, Amy, and Big, the gate will be open from the start if the level is accessible and closed if not.

### Sky Deck

For Sonic, Tails, Amy, Big, and Gamma, you have to transform the Egg Carrier to access the level.
In order to get to the front deck after transforming the Egg Carrier, you'll need both the Egglift and Monorail.

For Knuckles, you have to use the pool entrance.

The Sky Deck door won't open if the level is not accessible for the character.

### Lost World

For Sonic, Tails, Amy, Big and Gamma, you have to use the snake head entrance. It will be closed if the level is not
accessible.

For Knuckles, you'll have to use the gold and silver keys. They won't spawn if the level is not accessible for him.

### Final Egg

For Sonic,Tails, Amy, Knuckles and Big, you have to solve the puzzle to access the level.
The puzzle state is shared between all characters, so if you solve it with one character, the door will stay open.

For Gamma, you have to use the entrance to the left of the puzzle.

The doors won't open (and the load zone won't work) if the level is not accessible for the character.

### Hot Shelter

All characters use the same entrance.

The doors won't open if the level is not accessible for the character.

Remember that with Amy, and Big, you have to press the button first.
