# Level Entrance Randomizer

## How it works

If you enable the level entrance randomizer, the entrance to the action stages will be randomized.

If a given entrance is closed (e.g., doors not opening), it indicates that the level behind that entrance is not accessible.

For example, if Hot Shelter is inside the Emerald Coast entrance, the beach entrance will appear closed for Sonic but open for Amy.

## Levels with multiple entrances

Depending on the character you're playing, you might have access to different entrances. This is the list of every level with multiple entrances:

## Level list

This is a list of the levels, the requirements, and an explanation of how the entrances look when the level is accessible or not for your character.

### Emerald Coast

All characters use the same entrance.

If the level is not accessible, the entrance will have a gate blocking the way. If it is accessible, the entrance will be open.

For Gamma, the gate will always be there, but the targets won't show up if the level is not accessible.

### Windy Valley

All characters use the same entrance.

For Sonic, Tails, and Gamma, the Wind Stone won't spawn if the level is not accessible for the character. For Amy, Knuckles, and Big, it will open as soon as you get the Wind Stone (there is no in-game Wind Stone for them).

### Casinopolis

All characters use the same entrance.

For Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles, the button won't open the casino door if the level is not accessible for the character. For everyone else, the doors will be open from the start if the level inside is accessible.

### Ice Cap

All characters use the same entrance.

For Knuckles, Amy, and Gamma, the level will be accessible as soon as you get the Ice Stone (there is no in-game Ice Stone for them). For Sonic, Tails, and Big, you still have to fetch the actual Ice Stone.

The ladder (and the load zone) won't spawn if the level is not accessible for the character.

### Twinkle Park

All characters use the same entrance.

The level's door won't open if the level is not accessible for the character.

### Speed Highway

Sonic, Tails, Amy, and Gamma use the building entrance.

Knuckles and Big use the city hall entrance.

You'll need the Employee Card to enter the level.

The shutter/city hall doors won't open if the level is not accessible for the character.

Knuckles' city hall barricade won't spawn if the level is not accessible for him.

### Red Mountain

All characters use the same entrance.

For Sonic, Knuckles, and Gamma, the monkey will only spawn if the level is accessible for them.

For Tails, Amy, and Big, the gate will be open from the start if the level is accessible and closed if not.

### Sky Deck

For Sonic, Tails, and Big, you have to transform the Egg Carrier to access the level.

For Knuckles, Amy, and Gamma, you have to use the pool entrance.

The Sky Deck door won't open if the level is not accessible for the character.

### Lost World

For Sonic, Tails, Amy, Gamma, and Big, you have to use the snake head entrance. It will be closed if the level is not accessible.

For Knuckles, you'll have to use the gold and silver keys. They won't spawn if the level is not accessible for him.

### Final Egg

For Sonic and Amy, you have to solve the puzzle to access the level.

For Gamma, Knuckles, Big, and Tails, you have to use the entrance to the left of the puzzle.

The doors won't open (and the load zone won't work) if the level is not accessible for the character.

### Hot Shelter

All characters use the same entrance.

The doors won't open if the level is not accessible for the character.

Remember that with Amy, Big, and Gamma, you have to press the button first.
