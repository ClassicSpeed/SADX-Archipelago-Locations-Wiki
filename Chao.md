# Chao Checks

## Chao Eggs

To get the check, you have to bring every secret egg to the Chao Garden.

### Gold Chao Egg

Found in Station Square's City Hall area.
To access it, you'll need to bring the egg-shaped rock from the Chaos 0 fight area into the Antique Shop.
Replace the egg with the rock so you can leave the shop with it.
You can then take the egg to the Chao Garden to get the check. You'll need the Hotel Keys to the Hotel Area.

### Silver Chao Egg

Found in Mystic Ruins' main area.
Go to the small lake, where you fought Chaos 4, press the wall/button to the right of the cascade to release the egg.
Wait for it to float to the shore of the lake, pick it up and take it to the Chao Garden to get the check.

### Black Chao Egg

Found in the prison, inside the Egg Carrier.
You'll need to open the middle cell in the prison to access it.
Keep in mind that the Black Egg is only accessible by Amy, Gamma, or Big.

## Chao Races

Every Jewel Race counts as a check. You have to win the beginner races first to unlock them.
