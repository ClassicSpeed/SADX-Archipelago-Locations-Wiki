# Compatible Mods

## DC Conversion
Basically, every mod in the DC conversion is supported, except for the `Steam Achievements Mod`.

## Cream the Rabbit
The [Cream the Rabbit mod](https://gamebanana.com/mods/432782) is completely compatible with the randomizer. 
The city hall emblem was raised a bit to allow Cream to reach it with the help of Cheese.

## Super Sonic
The [Super Sonic mod](https://gamebanana.com/mods/49986) is completely compatible with the randomizer.
You can use it as is, but it's recommended to disable the "Remove limitations" option in the Super Sonic mod settings.

If you re-enable the limitations, you won't be allowed to play as Super Sonic until you get all the Chaos Emeralds.
Keep in mind that for the Chaos Emeralds to be part of the randomizer, you need to have them as part of the goal.

If your goal doesn't include the Chaos Emeralds, you can still play as Super Sonic from the start.
