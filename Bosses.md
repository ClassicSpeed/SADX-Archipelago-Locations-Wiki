# Bosses

Since bosses are normally part of the story, the mod adds warp platform to enter the boss fights.
The warp platforms are located in the adventure field, near of the location of the actual fight.

You can configure the boss fights to be unified. If you do so, you'll only have to fight them once and they only give
one check.
