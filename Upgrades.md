# Upgrades

All the upgrades locations that are available in their original location. Except for Tail's Rhythm Badge.

### Tail's Rhythm Badge

Since this upgrade is found in the past (and it's only accessed through the story), the mods adds a warp platform near
the master emerald shrine to travel to the past.
